# Sglifesaver
Our solution is to enhance emergency response through creating an app. Through this app, people will be able to contact medical professionals through a video call 
for emergency situations. While listening to the information being provided by the caller about the situation, the professional will also be able to get a better 
understanding of the situation through the live video. The professional will then be able to not only verbally instruct the caller on what to do but also send visual instructions, 
such as animations, that gives the caller a clearer idea on what to do to keep a person in critical condition alive and stable until the paramedics arrive. 
The app will make it much easier for the medical professional to access the condition and the caller to understand and take action quickly and accurately.
Ultimately this app allows for even the laymen to become a lifesaver.
